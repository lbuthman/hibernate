- Session, Transaction, Query -> interfaces as main points of dependency of business/control logic, called to perform
basic CRUD and querying operations.
- Configuration -> interface for configuring Hibernate
- Interceptor, Lifecycle, Validatable -> callback interfaces to react to events occurring
- UserType, CompositeUserType, IdentifierGenerator -> interface to extend Hibernate's mapping functionality

- Session interface -> primary interface; will need to create and destroy sessions all the time; not threadsafe; think
of it as a cache or collection of loaded objects relating to a single unit of work; sometimes called a "persistence
manager" because it is also the interface for persistence-related operations such as storing and retrieving objects

- SessionFactory interface -> provides Session instance; typically a single one for whole application or one for each
database; caches generated SQL statements and other mapping metadata that Hibernate uses at runtime

- Configuration interface -> configures and bootstraps Hibernate; used to specify the location of mapping documents
and Hibernate specific properties

- Transaction interface -> optional API, abstracts implementation code from the underlying transaction implementation.

- Query interface -> perform queries against the database and control how query is executed; written in HQL or SQL;
used to bind query parameters, limit returned results, and execute query

- Criteria interface -> allows you to create and execute object-oriented criteria queries

- Callback interace -> allows the application to recieve a notification when something interesting happens to an object
(loaded, saved, deleted, etc); Lifecycle and Validatable are examples but have fallen out of favor; Interceptor allows
callbacks but doesn't force persistent classes to implement Hibernate-specific APIs.

- Type object -> maps a Java type to a database column type; rich range of types covering all Java primitives and many
JDK classes, as well as custom types (UserType and CompositeUserType interfaces)
